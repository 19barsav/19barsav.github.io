title: About Me
subtitle: Savvy Barnes - Computer & Cognitive Scientist 
---

My expertise lies in the intersection of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and data science, with a rich background in both industry and academia. 

I hold **dual bachelor degrees** in **Computer Science** and **Psychology**, with minors in **Environmental Sustainability Studies**, **Philosophy**, and **Cognitive Science**. Recently, I have completed a **Master's of Science in Computer Science** with a specialization in **Cognitive Science**, all proudly earned from Michigan State University (**Go Green!**).

My journey has taken me through incredible experiences, from collaborating with **NASA Glenn's Graphical Visualization Team** to contributing my skills to **Kellanova's Global Data Science Team** and the **Interoperability Institute's Instructional Design and Synthetic Data** team. I've immersed myself in various research labs, contributing to projects in topics ranging from **natural language AI guidance** to exploring the intriguing connection between music and narrative with pattern recognition. 

In cognitive science, I've delved into the realm of **philosophy of science**, focusing on a modified version of Koskinen's risk account. In May, I will begin my second stint at **NASA Langley** in the **Safety-Critical Avionics Systems Branch**. This internship will combine my passion for safety and software engineering and philosophy. Additionally, I will be working in **child language acquisition** through a **linguistic** perspective on two projects over the summer and through the Fall. Finally, I have a **disability & autonomous vehicle systems** article in the works.

With a passion for **DEI** initiatives, I am dedicated to sharing my experiences and motivating the next generation of young scientists. I've been an integral part of the **Michigan Council for Women in Technology** for four years, wearing multiple hats as a scholar, speaker, and volunteer. Additionally, I served as the **Outreach Coordinator for Spartan Hackers**, where I have encouraged underrepresented groups to explore computer science and engineering through hackathons and community building. As a student teacher, I have taught **CSE 231 - Introduction to Python Programming** for five years - mentoring students through several milestones and major life-events. I hope to continue teaching and exploring outreach opportunities as my career progresses.

I am always excited to collaborate and learn from others; **I believe that the best work comes from working together**.
