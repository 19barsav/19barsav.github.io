title: About Me
subtitle: Savvy Barnes - Computer & Cognitive Scientist 
---

My expertise lies in the intersection of artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and data science, with a rich background in both industry and academia. 

I hold **dual bachelor degrees** in **Computer Science** and **Psychology**, with minors in **Environmental Sustainability Studies**, **Philosophy**, and **Cognitive Science**. Following, I have a **Master's of Science in Computer Science** with a specialization in **Cognitive Science** and am currently enrolled as a Ph.D. student in **Linguistics**. (**Go Green!**).

Throughout my career, I have worked with **NASA Glenn's Graphical Visualization Team**, **NASA Langley Formal Metthods Team**, **Kellanova's Global Data Science Team**, and the **Interoperability Institute's Instructional Design and Synthetic Data** team. I've previously belonged to various research labs from across the University in the Department of COmputer Science, the Department of English, and the Department of Linguistics. I am currently a member of the Language Acquistion lab in the Department of Linguistics.

With a passion for broadening STEM involvement and participation, I am dedicated to sharing my experiences and motivating the next generation of young scientists. I've been an integral part of the **Michigan Council for Women in Technology** for four years where I have been a scholar, speaker, and volunteer. Additionally, I served as the **Outreach Coordinator for Spartan Hackers**, where I encouraged my peers to explore computer science and engineering through hackathons and community building. As a student teacher, I have taught **CSE 231 - Introduction to Python Programming** for five years - mentoring students through several milestones and major life-events. Currently, I am a **Teaching-Specialist** in the **Department of Statistics and Probability**, where I am core faculty for the Master's of Science in Data Science Program. I serve as the instructor for STT 810 (Mathematical Statistics for Data Scientists) and STT 811 (Applied Statistical Modeling for Data Scientists), and I serve as an advisor for the program. 

I am always excited to collaborate and learn from others; **I believe that the best work comes from working together**.
